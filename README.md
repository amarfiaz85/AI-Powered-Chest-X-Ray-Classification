# AI-Powered-Chest-X-Ray-Classification
This project presents an AI-powered chest X-ray classification system designed to assist in the early detection of pneumonia. Using deep learning, we trained a ResNet101 model on a dataset of chest X-ray images and achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between Normal and Pneumonia cases.
ðŸ©º Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays using Deep Learning
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project presents an AI-powered chest X-ray classification system designed to assist in the early detection of pneumonia. Using deep learning, we trained a ResNet101 model on a dataset of chest X-ray images and achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between Normal and Pneumonia cases.

To make the solution portable and easy to deploy, the trained model was converted into TorchScript (.pt) format and integrated into a Flask web application. The system provides a user-friendly interface where users can upload chest X-ray images and instantly receive predictions.

This project demonstrates the potential of AI in healthcare by offering fast, reliable, and accessible diagnostic support.
