# AI-Powered-Chest-X-Ray-Classification
This project presents an AI-powered chest X-ray classification system designed to assist in the early detection of pneumonia. Using deep learning, we trained a ResNet101 model on a dataset of chest X-ray images and achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between Normal and Pneumonia cases.
